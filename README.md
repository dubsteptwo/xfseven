# Xfseven
Xfseven is a set of themes to make Xfce look as close to Windows 7 Aero as possible. It is based on ![Windows 7](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-7/tree/master) by B00merang-Project

# Additional
**Blur**: If you want transparency blur (which does a lot of heavy lifting), you will either need [Xfwm-effects](https://www.kalideva.com/) or [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), configs for both are provided.

**Microsoft Fonts**: Microsoft fonts have differing names depending on the package manager, so you will need to look it up for your distro. The system font used is Segoe UI Variable.

**Terminal font**: The font in the screenshots is [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)

**Icons**: The icon theme used in the screenshots is [Windows-7](https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-7) by B00merang-Artwork

**Xfwm4 Theme**: [X-Aero](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1016331) by PaChu

**Cursors**: [Aerodrop](https://www.pling.com/p/999406/) by oem68



# Install
Currently, only manual install is available. 

Copy  `xfseven-gtk` to `/home/yourname/.themes` and the contents of `dotconfig/` to `/home/yourname/.config/` **(make sure to back up /.config/xfce4's current contents, as it will overwrite them! I.e, your panel settings, window manager settings etc.)**, then restart your PC, and it should take effect.

I will write a script to make all of this automatic... at some point.
